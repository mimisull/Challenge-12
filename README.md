**Resampling Loan Data**

Specifically, I am building a tool to determine healthy loans versus unhealthy loans.

I accomplish this by running a model including logical regression and then resampling the data.

*User Story*:
As a user, I need to determine what are healthy loans.

As a user, I need to be able to create an algorithm that can be used repeatedly.
